      <p>Ye are ye olde serf and ye live in kingdom with other olde serfs. Ye never fully understood why ye were considered an “olde” serf because ye are in fact a Yung Serf. Like ye are a rapper, named Yung Serf. Ye bring the music to the people.</p>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="contentblock">
    <div class="boxtextstyle">
        <p> Ye shall make joy and merriment in the village square, just as yer forefathers before ye. The Yung Serf shall rise and tell the tale of the hippest rappers that ever dropped ye old rhymes, fo shizzle. But hark! As ye make yer way to the hippity-wickety village, what is that ye see over yonder horizon?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="contentblock">
    <div class="boxtextstyle">
        <p>Wondering over yonder isn’t that his highness himself, wikkity boppity! Hippity wickety village shall feast with the utmost celebration as our ye forefathers. We must rhyme with wine and sing with our tales till the moon rises!</p>

    <div class="boxtextstyle">
        <p>Ye Yung Serf concert has attracted all the high rollers in Ye Olde Kingdom (or should I say Ye Yung Kingdom?). You grab yon speaking horn and begin to drop the most sicketh poem of all poem. Before ye know it, all of the crowd jameth and feel good. </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="contentblock">
    <div class="boxtextstyle">
        <p>As ye look among the crowd, ye spy a familiar countenance: that of the fair maiden whom ye courted those many years ago. Ye are at once reminded of the bitter rift that was driven betwixt ye when her lord father dissed the rhymes that ye spitteth, banishing ye from the neighboring kingdom. Yer voice falters for the briefest of minutes as yon eyes lock with hers.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="contentblock">
    <div class="boxtextstyle">
        <p>The words were faint but the fair maiden called here ye, what should i do in this time of thee? Here she starts wondering over ye. What disposition that has called her upon thee? Is it time to relinquish my rhymes to show thy progress of mine for there could be hope of reliving those nights?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="contentblock">
    <div class="boxtextstyle">
        <p>Bah, wenches hath no space in ye life. Ye lay only with the limericks ye spit. Ye stick yon hand out at thee maiden approaching, “Begone wench. Bother me not with ye distractions from the music. Speaketh to the hand.” .</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="contentblock">
    <div class="boxtextstyle">
        <p>The fair maiden turneth away as the crowd stares. A moment passes. Ye know that in a different life, the two of ye could have been happy together. But ye did not choose Ye Olde Thug Life, Ye Olde Thug Life chose ye. As the rhythm returns to the village square, ye shout one out to all yon homies.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="contentblock">
    <div class="boxtextstyle">
        <p>The newest road that thee has chosen, will continue to pave. With the homies and my rhymes, we shall rule the harshest days. With my feverous learning and the homies by thy side, the world shall know the life and the brothers known as McRippin Dimes.</p>
